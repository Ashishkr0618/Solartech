        <div class="t1">An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy characterized by its elliptical shape, as opposed to the spiral shape of galaxies like the Milky Way. These galaxies range from nearly spherical to elongated ellipses. They are typically composed of older stars and have little to no gas or dust, which means star formation is minimal. This lack of gas makes them different from spiral galaxies, which have active star formation in their arms.
            Elliptical galaxies are often found in galaxy clusters and can vary greatly in size, from smaller ones with a few billion stars to massive ones containing trillions of stars. They are generally more spherical in shape than irregular galaxies and have a smooth, featureless appearance. The stars in elliptical galaxies tend to move in random orbits, unlike the organized rotation seen in spiral galaxies.These galaxies are also older, with most of their star formation occurring early in the universe's history, and they are thought to be the result of galaxy mergers. While elliptical galaxies are less visually striking than spiral galaxies, they are key to understanding the evolution and dynamics of galaxies.

                               <li><pre><span class="c">Little Gas and Dust:</span>Unlike spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies have little to no gas<br>and dust, which means there is little new star formation.</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="c">Galaxy Mergers:</span>Many elliptical galaxies are thought to be the result of the merger of<br>smaller galaxies, which is why they often appear smooth and lack the structure of<br>spiral galaxies.</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="c">Found in Clusters:</span>They are often located in the dense centers of galaxy clusters<br>where galaxy collisions and mergers are more common.</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="c">High Stellar Density:</span>In the central regions, elliptical galaxies can have a very high density<br>of stars, with stars packed much closer together than in spiral galaxies.</pre></li><br>
