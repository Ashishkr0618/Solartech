        <div class="t1">The M101 Galaxy, also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, is a large, face-on spiral galaxy located about 21 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. With a diameter of around 170,000 light-years, it is nearly twice the size of the Milky Way and contains a massive number of stars, possibly over a trillion. M101 is notable for its well-defined spiral arms, which host a high concentration of star-forming regions and young, bright blue stars, giving it a striking and vibrant appearance. The galaxy has an asymmetrical shape, likely due to gravitational interactions with neighboring galaxies, which may have caused bursts of star formation in its arms. M101 is also rich in star clusters, nebulae, and gas clouds, making it a fascinating object for astronomers studying galactic structure and star formation.
