        <div class="t1">Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the outermost region of our solar system, beyond Neptune in the Kuiper Belt. Once classified as the ninth planet, it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union due to its small size and inability to clear its orbit of other debris. Pluto is made mostly of rock and ice, and has a thin atmosphere composed of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. It has five known moons, with Charon being the largest, almost half the size of Pluto itself. Pluto’s surface features include vast plains, mountains made of water ice, and frozen methane, as well as large heart-shaped regions like Tombaugh Regio. In 2015, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made a historic flyby of Pluto, sending back detailed images and data that revealed much about its geology, atmosphere, and moons. Despite its reclassification, Pluto remains one of the most fascinating objects in our solar system.
