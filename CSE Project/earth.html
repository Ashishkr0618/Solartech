        <div class="t1">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known place in the universe that supports life. It has a unique mix of an oxygen-rich atmosphere, liquid water, and a protective magnetic field, all of which make life possible. Earth is made up of a core, mantle, and crust, with tectonic plates that cause earthquakes and mountain formation. Its atmosphere, mostly nitrogen and oxygen, regulates temperature and weather. Covering about 71% of Earth's surface, water supports life through a global water cycle. Orbiting the Sun at about 93 million miles, Earth takes 365.25 days to complete one orbit, while rotating every 24 hours to create day and night. This balance of natural features enables Earth's diverse ecosystems.
