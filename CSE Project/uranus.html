        <div class="t1">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its unique tilt, as it rotates on its side at a 98-degree angle, unlike any other planet in the solar system. This unusual tilt causes extreme seasonal variations, with long periods of daylight and darkness at its poles. Uranus is an ice giant, composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and icy substances like water, ammonia, and methane, giving it a distinct blue-green color. It has a faint ring system, and its atmosphere features strong winds and storms. Uranus has 27 known moons, with Miranda, Ariel, and Titania being the largest. Despite being an intriguing planet, it remains one of the least explored, with only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, having visited it during a flyby in 1986.

                                <li><pre><span class="c">Sideways Rotation:</span>Uranus is unique in that it rotates on its side, with an<br>axial tilt of 98° causing extreme seasonal shifts.</pre></li><br>
                                <li><pre><span class="c">Ice Giant:</span>Unlike the gas giants, Uranus is classified as an "ice giant,"<br>composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and icy materials like water, methane, and ammonia.</pre></li><br>
                                <li><pre><span class="c">Methane Atmosphere:</span>The presence of methane in its atmosphere gives Uranus<br>its blue-green color by absorbing red light.</pre></li><br>
                                <li><pre><span class="c">Coldest Planet:</span>Uranus has the coldest atmosphere in the solar system, with temperatures<br> dropping as low as -224°C (-371°F).</pre></li><br>
                                <li><pre><span class="c">27 Moons:</span>Uranus has 27 known moons, with Titania, Oberon, Ariel, and Miranda being the<br>largest.</pre></li><br>
                                <li><pre><span class="c">No Known Moons with Life:</span>Unlike some moons of other planets, none of Uranus’s moons have<br>been considered likely to support life due to extreme cold and lack of water.</pre></li>

                                <li><pre><span class="d">Atmospheric Composition:</span>Uranus has a lot of methane in its atmosphere, but scientists are unsure why<br>it doesn't have as much of the more volatile gases that other ice giants like Neptune do.</pre></li><br>
                                <li><pre><span class="d">Miranda’s Weird Surface:</span>The moon Miranda has an incredibly varied surface with strange cliffs, valleys<br>and ridges, leading to speculation that it might have undergone some kind of massive disruption in the past.</pre></li><br>
                                <li><pre><span class="d">Unknown Source of Heat:</span>Uranus is colder than expected, given its size and distance from the Sun<br>Despite this, it radiates more heat than it receives, but the exact cause of this internal heat source<br>remains a mystery.</pre></li><br>
                                <li><pre><span class="d">Strange Tilt:</span>Uranus' extreme tilt (98°) is still unexplained. It might have been caused by a massive<br>collision with another planet-sized object early in its history, but the details remain unclear.</pre></li><br>
                                <li><pre><span class="d">Ring Formation Mystery:</span>While Uranus has faint rings, it’s unclear how they formed or why they’re so<br>dark and narrow. Some theories suggest they could be remnants of moons that were shattered by collisions.</pre></li>
