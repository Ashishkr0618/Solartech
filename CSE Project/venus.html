        <div class="t1">Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is similar in size and structure to Earth, earning it the nickname "Earth's twin." However, Venus has a hostile environment, with surface temperatures reaching around 465째C (869째F) due to a runaway greenhouse effect caused by its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. The dense clouds of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere reflect sunlight, making Venus one of the brightest objects in the night sky, often visible near sunrise or sunset.

            Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction to most planets, with one day on Venus lasting about 243 Earth days. Its volcanic landscape includes vast plains, large plateaus, and thousands of volcanoes. The extreme heat and atmospheric pressure make it challenging for spacecraft to explore Venus, yet missions from NASA, ESA, and other space agencies continue to study this mysterious and fiery world.
