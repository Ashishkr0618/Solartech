        <div class="t1">Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is known as the "Red Planet" due to its iron-rich, rusty surface. Roughly half the size of Earth, Mars has a thin atmosphere mainly made of carbon dioxide, resulting in drastic temperature changes between day and night. The Martian surface is home to remarkable geological features, including Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system, and Valles Marineris, an immense canyon system. While Mars is now dry, scientists believe it had liquid water billions of years ago; today, water exists in the form of ice at the poles and possibly as salty underground reservoirs. Numerous missions, such as NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, explore Mars to learn about its history and potential for past life. This ongoing exploration fuels interest in Mars as a future target for human exploration and even colonization.
