        <div class="t1">Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is a gas giant, composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a striking blue color. Neptune has the strongest winds in the solar system, with speeds reaching up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph), and is known for its violent storms, including the Great Dark Spot, a massive storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. It has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest. Triton is unique because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction to the planet's rotation, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune’s gravity. Despite being far from the Sun, Neptune emits more heat than it receives, a mystery that scientists are still studying. Neptune was the last planet in our solar system to be discovered, in 1846, and remains a subject of interest due to its extreme distance and harsh conditions.

                               <li><pre><span class="d">Triton’s Reversed Orbit:</span>Triton, Neptune’s largest moon, orbits in the opposite direction of the planet’s<br>rotation. This suggests it was captured by Neptune’s gravity, but how it was captured remains unclear.</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="d">Strange Winds:</span>Neptune’s winds, which can reach supersonic speeds, are much faster than expected for a planet<br>so far from the Sun. The source of these extreme winds is still a mystery.</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="d">Faint and Unstable Rings:</span>Neptune's faint rings are not as well understood as those of other planets like<br>Saturn. They are also believed to be quite young and might not last long, but their origin and longevity<br>are unknown.</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="d">Changing Storms:</span>Neptune's storms, like the Great Dark Spot, appear and disappear unpredictably. The cause<br>of this dynamic storm system is not fully understood.</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="d">Methane’s Role:</span>Methane plays a major role in Neptune’s atmosphere, but scientists aren’t sure why the methane<br>concentrations on Neptune are so much higher compared to other gas giants.</pre></li>
