        <div class="t1">The Milky Way Galaxy is a vast, barred spiral galaxy that includes our solar system. It spans about 100,000 light-years in diameter and contains roughly 100 to 400 billion stars, including our Sun, which is located around 27,000 light-years from the center. The galaxy's structure consists of a central bulge, spiral arms, and a surrounding halo. At its center lies a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*, with a mass millions of times that of the Sun. The Milky Way is about 13.6 billion years old, nearly as old as the universe itself, and is moving towards a collision with the Andromeda Galaxy in around 4.5 billion years. It is part of the Local Group, a collection of galaxies that includes Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy.

                               <li><pre><span class="c">Massive Black Hole at the Center:</span>The Milky Way's center houses a supermassive black hole<br>Sagittarius A*, which has a mass approximately 4 million times that of the Sun.</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="c">Our Position:</span>The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, a minor spiral arm of the Milky<br>Way, about 27,000 light-years from the galactic center.</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="c">Colliding with Andromeda:</span>The Milky Way is on a collision course with the Andromeda Galaxy<br>They will collide and merge in about 4.5 billion years, forming a new galaxy, often referred<br>to as "Milkomeda."</pre></li><br>
                               <li><pre><span class="c">Invisible Matter:</span>Most of the mass of the Milky Way, and most galaxies, is in the form of dark<br>matter, which cannot be seen but is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter.</pre></li>
