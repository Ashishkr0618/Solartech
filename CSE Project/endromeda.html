        <div class="t1">The Andromeda Galaxy (also known as M31) is the closest large galaxy to the Milky Way, located about 2.5 million light-years away in the constellation Andromeda. It is a massive spiral galaxy, roughly 220,000 light-years in diameter, making it larger than the Milky Way and home to about one trillion stars. Andromeda is approaching the Milky Way at around 110 kilometers per second, and it’s predicted that the two galaxies will collide and merge in about 4.5 billion years, forming a new galaxy. Andromeda is also known for its bright nucleus, spiral arms rich in star-forming regions, and numerous satellite galaxies. It is easily visible to the naked eye from Earth and has been a significant object of study in understanding galaxy structures, dynamics, and evolution.
