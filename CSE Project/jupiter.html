        <div class="t1">Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a massive gas giant known for its colorful, swirling clouds and the iconic Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. Composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, Jupiter has no solid surface, and its atmosphere is marked by intense storms and fast-moving winds. With a powerful magnetic field, it emits more heat than it receives from the Sun, indicating it has a hot, dense core. Jupiter has 79 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system, and Europa, which may harbor a subsurface ocean with potential for life. The planet’s immense size, magnetic field, and dynamic atmosphere make it a fascinating subject for astronomers and a key to understanding gas giants beyond our solar system.
