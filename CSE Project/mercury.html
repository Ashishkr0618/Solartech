        <div class="t1">Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the one closest to the Sun. With a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers, it’s only slightly larger than Earth's Moon and has a very thin atmosphere, called an exosphere, composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. This thin atmosphere offers little insulation, leading to extreme temperature changes: from scorching 430°C (800°F) during the day to freezing -180°C (-290°F) at night.

            Its rocky surface is marked by craters and cliffs, a result of ancient impacts and geological activity. Mercury completes an orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, making its year the shortest of all planets. However, a day on Mercury (from one sunrise to the next) lasts 176 Earth days due to its slow rotation. Its proximity to the Sun and lack of atmosphere make it a fascinating but hostile environment.
